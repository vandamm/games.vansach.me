# GameCache - View and filter your boardgame collection

> [!WARNING]
> Project renamed: This project was previously called "MyBGG" and is now "GameCache". Existing deployments using the old name continue to work (asset names and the CORS proxy remain compatible), but new forks should use the new name and paths shown below.


_This repository is published as a **GitHub Template**. Create your own copy via "Use this template" (recommended) rather than forking. The canonical upstream lives at: https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/gamecache_

Create a beautiful, searchable website for your BoardGameGeek collection! This project downloads your games from BoardGameGeek, creates a database, and automatically hosts it as a website using GitHub Pages.

* Computer with Python 3.8-3.12 installed.
   <details>
      <summary>Using a newer Python version?</summary>
      This project is tested with Python versions up to 3.12. If you are using a newer version (like 3.13+), you may need to regenerate the dependencies file. After installing `pip-tools` (`pip install pip-tools`), run the following command:
      ```bash
      pip-compile scripts/requirements.in -o scripts/requirements.txt
      ```
      Then, proceed with the installation command in step 4.
   </details>

## Getting started

1. **Create a repository from this template.**
   <details>
      <summary>Details</summary>
   On the repository page click the green **Use this template** button ‚Üí **Create a new repository**. Pick a name (you can keep `gamecache` or choose something else). Leave **Include all branches** unchecked. Click **Create repository**. You now have your own independent copy (not a fork) that can pull updates from upstream manually.
   </details>

2. **Update the config.ini file** with your details:

   **Easy way (recommended)**: Edit directly on GitHub:
   * Go to the repository you just created on GitHub
   * Click on `config.ini`
   * Click the pencil icon (‚úèÔ∏è) to edit
   * Replace `YOUR_NAME` with your name (for the website title)
   * Replace `YOUR_BGG_USERNAME` with your BoardGameGeek username  
   * Replace `YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME` with your GitHub username
   * Scroll down and click **"Commit changes"**

   **Example**: If your name is John, BGG username is `johnsmith`, and GitHub username is `johnsmith123`:
   ```ini
   # GameCache Configuration
   # Edit the values below with your information

   title = "John's boardgames"
   bgg_username = johnsmith
   github_repo = johnsmith123/gamecache
   ```

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: Make sure your config is valid! Common mistakes:
   - Missing `=` between key and value
   - For values with apostrophes or spaces, use quotes: `title = "John's boardgames"`

   **How to find your BGG username**: It's in your BoardGameGeek profile URL. For example, if your profile is `https://boardgamegeek.com/user/johnsmith`, your username is `johnsmith`.

   <details>
      <summary>Alternative: Edit on your computer</summary>

      * Clone your new project: `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/REPO_NAME.git`
      * Edit the `config.ini` file
      * Commit and push your changes:
      ```bash
      git add config.ini
      git commit -m "Update config.ini with my details"
      git push
      ```
   </details>

3. **Enable GitHub Pages** to host your website:
   <details>
      <summary>Step-by-step instructions</summary>

      * Go to your repository on GitHub
      * Click the **Settings** tab (at the top of your repository page)
      * Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar and click it
      * Under "Source", select **Deploy from a branch**
      * Under "Branch", choose **master**
      * Leave the folder as **/ (root)**
      * Click **Save**

      **Verification**: You should see a green checkmark and a message like "Your site is published at https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gamecache". This might take a few minutes to appear.

      ‚è∞ **Note**: GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to activate. Your website will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gamecache` (after you generate your database in step 5)
   </details>

4. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   ```

   <details>
      <summary>Python installation help</summary>

      **If you don't have Python installed:**
      * Download Python 3.8+ from https://python.org
      * During installation, make sure to check "Add Python to PATH"
      * Restart your terminal/command prompt after installing

      **If the command above doesn't work, try:**
      * `pip3 install -r scripts/requirements.txt`
      * `python -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`
      * `python3 -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`

      **Verification**: You should see messages about packages being installed successfully. If you see "Successfully installed..." at the end, you're good to go!
   </details>

5. **Validate your setup** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python scripts/validate_setup.py
   ```

   This checks that your config.ini is valid, your BGG username exists, and all Python dependencies are installed. If everything looks good, proceed to step 6!

6. **Generate your database**:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_and_index.py
   ```

   <details>
      <summary>What to expect</summary>

      **‚è∞ Time**: First run takes 5-15 minutes depending on your collection size  
      **üîç Process**: The script will:
      1. Download all your games from BoardGameGeek (this is the slow part)
      2. Create a SQLite database with your games and their metadata
      3. Compress it to save space
      4. Ask you to authenticate with GitHub (opens browser)
      5. Upload it as a GitHub release

      **GitHub Authentication** (happens during step 4):
      * The script will print a URL and a device code
      * Your browser will open to GitHub
      * Enter the device code when prompted
      * Sign in to your GitHub account
      * Click "Authorize" to give permission
      * Return to your terminal - the upload will continue automatically

      **Success indicators**:
      * You'll see "Imported X games and Y expansions from boardgamegeek"
      * You'll see "Created SQLite database with X games and Y expansions"
      * You'll see "Successfully uploaded to GitHub: [URL]"
      * Your website will be available at: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gamecache`
   </details>

## üîÑ Enable Automatic Hourly Updates (Optional)

Want your website to stay up-to-date automatically? You can enable hourly updates that will sync your collection from BoardGameGeek every hour without any manual work!

**Requirements**: You must complete the Getting Started steps above first.

**To enable hourly updates**:
```bash
python scripts/enable_hourly_updates.py
```

<details>
   <summary>How it works</summary>

   **What this does**:
   * Sets up GitHub Actions to run automatically every hour
   * Downloads your latest collection from BoardGameGeek  
   * Updates your website with any new games, ratings, or plays
   * Completely automated - no manual work required

   **What to expect**:
   * The script extracts your GitHub authentication token from your local setup
   * Creates a secure repository secret for GitHub Actions to use
   * Enables the hourly workflow that's already configured in your repository

   **Privacy & Security**:
   * Your authentication token is stored securely as a GitHub repository secret
   * Only your repository's automated workflows can access it
   * The token has minimal permissions (only access to create releases)

   **After setup**:
   * Check the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to see the hourly runs
   * Your website will automatically reflect any changes to your BGG collection
   * Updates happen every hour on the hour (e.g., 1:00 PM, 2:00 PM, etc.)
</details>

## What to Expect

**First-time setup**: 15-30 minutes total
- Steps 1-4: 5-10 minutes (mostly waiting for downloads)
- Step 5 (validation): 30 seconds
- Step 6 (database generation): 5-15 minutes (depends on collection size)
- GitHub Pages activation: 5-15 minutes (happens automatically in background)

**Collection sizes and timing**:
- Small collection (< 50 games): 1-3 minutes
- Medium collection (50-200 games): 3-5 minutes  
- Large collection (200+ games): 5-10 minutes

**What the script downloads**:
- Basic game information (name, year, players, etc.)
- Detailed metadata (categories, mechanics, descriptions)
- Ratings and rankings from BGG
- Game images (thumbnails)
- Your personal data (ratings, plays, comments)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Setup Issues

**"No games imported" error**:
- Check that your BGG username in `config.ini` is correct (no spaces, special characters)
- Make sure your BoardGameGeek collection is set to public ([BGG Collection Settings](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/settings))
- Verify you have games marked as "owned" in your BGG collection
- Try the validation script: `python scripts/validate_setup.py`

**"pip not found" or "python not found"**:
- Make sure Python 3.8+ is installed from https://python.org
- On Windows: Make sure "Add Python to PATH" was checked during installation
- Try alternatives: `python3` instead of `python`, `pip3` instead of `pip`
- On Windows: Try `py -m pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt`

**GitHub authentication fails**:
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub in your browser
- Check your internet connection
- Clear your browser cache and try again
- Make sure popup blockers aren't preventing the GitHub page from opening

**Website shows "Loading database..." forever**:
- **Most common**: GitHub Pages isn't enabled yet ‚Üí Go to Settings ‚Üí Pages and enable it
- **Second most common**: Script hasn't been run yet ‚Üí Run `python scripts/download_and_index.py --cache_bgg`
- Wait 10-15 minutes after enabling GitHub Pages (it takes time to activate)
- Check that the script said "Successfully uploaded to GitHub" when you ran it
- Try accessing your site in an incognito/private browser window (clears cache)

**Invalid configuration syntax**:
- Make sure each line follows the format: `key = value`
- For values with apostrophes or spaces, use quotes: `title = "John's boardgames"`
- Check that there are no extra spaces around the `=` sign
- Comments should start with `#`
- If syntax highlighting looks broken, make sure apostrophes are inside quotes

### Less Common Issues

**Script runs but no games appear on website**:
- Check your BGG collection privacy settings (must be public)
- Make sure games are marked as "owned" in your BGG collection
- Try running without `--cache_bgg` to get fresh data: `python scripts/download_and_index.py`

**"Failed to fetch database" error on website**:
- The script upload might have failed - check for "Successfully uploaded" message
- GitHub releases might not be working - check your repository's Releases tab
- Try running the script again

**Website loads but search/filtering doesn't work**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors (F12 ‚Üí Console tab)
- Try refreshing the page or clearing browser cache
- Make sure JavaScript is enabled in your browser

## Using your website

Once you've generated your database, you'll have a working website for browsing and searching your board game collection. The website:

* **Loads your data**: Fetches the SQLite database from your GitHub releases
* **Provides search**: Real-time search and filtering of your games
* **Shows game details**: Rich information from BoardGameGeek including ratings, descriptions, mechanics, etc.

To view your website:
- Go to: `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/gamecache`
- Or view it locally by running `python -m http.server` and opening `http://localhost:8000`

## Working with the site locally (optional)

You can also run the website locally on your computer:

1. Start a local web server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```

2. Open your browser to `http://localhost:8000`

This is useful for testing changes to the website before pushing them to GitHub.

## Updating your database

To update your database with new games or changed ratings:

1. Run the script again:
   ```bash
   python scripts/download_and_index.py
   ```

2. A new release will be created automatically with the updated database

3. Your website will automatically use the new database (may take a few minutes)

## Advanced usage

* **Skip GitHub upload** (for testing): Add `--no_upload` flag
* **Enable debug logging**: Add `--debug` flag  
* **Use custom config file**: Add `--config path/to/config.ini`

## Keeping Your Copy Updated

Because you created your repository from a **template** (not a fork), GitHub will NOT show the built‚Äëin "Sync fork" button. Updating is still easy:

1. (First time) **Add upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/gamecache.git
   ```
2. **Fetch upstream**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git merge upstream/master
   ```
3. **Merge or rebase** the main branch (pick one style and stick with it):
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main   # keeps explicit merge commits
   # or
   git rebase upstream/main  # linear history
   ```
4. **Resolve any conflicts**, update dependencies if needed, then:
   ```bash
   pip install -r scripts/requirements.txt
   git push
   ```

### Watching for Upstream Changes
Star or watch the upstream repo to get notified of releases. Release notes will summarize noteworthy changes (schema, flags, etc.).

### Updating after the rename

If your fork predates the rename, or you see errors like:

```
remote: Repository not found.
fatal: repository 'https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/mybgg.git/' not found
```

Update your `upstream` to the new URL and pull the latest changes:

```bash
git remote set-url upstream https://github.com/EmilStenstrom/gamecache.git
git fetch upstream
git checkout master
git merge upstream/master
```
